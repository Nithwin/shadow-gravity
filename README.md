In the world of **Google Antigravity**, agents float. They drift. They hallucinate.
**Shadow Gravity** pulls them back to reality.

It is a strict, opinionated scaffolder that treats AI Agents like **Shadow Soldiers**:
* They must follow orders (The Plan).
* They cannot stop until the mission is complete (Green Tests).
* They cannot speak nonsense (No Hallucinated Imports).

## 🗡️ Usage

Since this is hosted on GitHub, you can run it directly:

```bash
# Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username
npx github:YOUR_USERNAME/shadow-gravity
```

## 🧠 The Protocol
When you run this, it injects a **Gravity Core** (`.antigravity/`) into your project. This forces the IDE Agent to enter a **Red-Green-Refactor Loop** designed to prevent "AI Slop".

### S-Rank Mode
If you select "S-Rank" during creation, the tool injects extra constraints:
- **No TODOs Allowed**: The build fails if you leave them.
- **Strict Typing**: Usage of `any` is forbidden (in TS projects).
- **Mandatory Arise**: You must use the `npm run arise` command to start the agent.

## 🔮 The "Arise" Command
Once your project is created, wake up your agent with the specialized command:

```bash
npm run arise
```

This triggers the **Mission Protocol**, ensuring your agent has the full context and constraints loaded into its memory.
